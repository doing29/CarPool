# CarPool
This is an instruction for organizing Carpool project.

1) Everybody should go to see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJune0EMP94 to set up your github in Android stuido(just tuturial 1).

2) Import project following https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25348339/how-to-import-an-existing-project-from-github-into-android-studio. And u can folk your own branch after that. Please integrate the project code by this method. That's why we take github as our version control tool.

3) After import to the newest version to your Android Studio(AS), u should click Project -> clean project then build. If your AS version is up-to-date, after the gradle compile, everything should be Okey. Slack me if it does work.

I will create a directory named Document so that to whom does not code, you can still put some progresses here. But I just pull them up, plz organize by yourself.
